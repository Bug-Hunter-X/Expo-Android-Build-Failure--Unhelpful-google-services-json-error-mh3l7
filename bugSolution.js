The solution involves ensuring the `google-services.json` file is correctly configured and placed within your Expo Android project.  A common mistake is using an incorrect file or placing it in the wrong directory. 

**Incorrect Setup (bug.js):**

```javascript
// Placeholder - Demonstrates a potential scenario with incorrect config, wrong file path, etc. 
// No actual code needed here as the issue is configuration, not code
```

**Correct Setup (bugSolution.js):**

```javascript
// This file won't contain code to directly fix the issue. The fix is in project configuration and setup, not code. 
// The core solution is correctly placing and configuring the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory of your expo project. 
// Verify the file's content also matches your firebase setup
```
